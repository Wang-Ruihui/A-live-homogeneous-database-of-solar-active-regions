# The-detection-method-of-an-homogeneous-database

This is the detection method code and detected ARs of our homogeneous database of solar active regions (AR). 

According to our calibration, the AR flux of HMI synoptic magnetograms (i.e. ARs after Carrington rotation (CR) 2097(included) ) need to multiply a fator 1.36.
